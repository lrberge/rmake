Description: Automatically keeps the results (i.e. outputs) of a project up to 
  date vis a vis upstream code modifications. 
  Only the minimal set of code affected by upstream changes is run.
  Only requires minimal to no user input thanks to the automatic, and static, 
  dependencies detection (dependencies on functions and files).
